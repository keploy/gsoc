# About Keploy
Keploy is a no-code testing platform that generates tests from API calls. 

It captures the external dependency network calls (like database queries, internal/external services) for each request to replay them (including writes/mutations!) later during testing. 

Developers can use keploy alongside their favorite unit testing framework to save time writing testcases.  

# Keploy + Google Summer of Code, 2026
This is the main place for all information related to Keploy's participation in Google Summer of Code, 2026 as a mentoring organization.

## What is Google Summer of Code?

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a 16 years old program, run every summer, with the intention of bringing more students into open source. 

Open source projects apply as mentor organizations and if they are accepted, students send proposals to them to work on a few months' long project. Projects can be planned out by the organizations in advance or can be proposed by students.

Google pays the students, not the organizations they work with. Beginning in 2024, Google is opening the program up to all newcomers of open source that are 18 years and older.

You can read more about the format of the program and its goals [here](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/).

# Additional Information

## Who can propose a project and who can be a mentor?

Keploy members and members from the wider community can both propose projects, however, only Keploy members can be mentors.

## What is expected of a mentor?
Please read [The Mentor Guide](MENTOR-GUIDE.md).

## Information for applying students

Students should have knowledge of git, go, and markdown for most projects since the project work heavily depends on them.

We invite students to look into [our open proposals](https://github.com/keploy/gsoc/tree/main/2023), ask mentors questions to understand the projects better and if interested apply for the project when the application period opens.

Mentors would like to know why the project interests the student, whether they have the pre-requisite skills, and most importantly, how they plan to implement it.

We encourage Contributors to set up Keploy for local development and play around with the code and tests to get more comfortable with the project.
