# About Keploy
Keploy is a no-code testing platform that generates tests from API calls.

It captures the external dependency network calls (like database queries, internal/external services) for each request to replay them (including writes/mutations!) later during testing.

Developers can use Keploy alongside their favorite unit testing framework to save time writing test cases.

# Keploy + Google Summer of Code, 2026
This is the main place for all information related to Keploy's participation in Google Summer of Code, 2026 as a mentoring organization.

## What is Google Summer of Code?

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program, run every summer, with the intention of bringing more contributors into open source.

Open source projects apply as mentor organizations and if they are accepted, contributors send proposals to them to work on a few months' long project. Projects can be planned out by the organizations in advance or can be proposed by contributors.

Google pays the contributors, not the organizations they work with. The program is open to all newcomers of open source that are 18 years and older.

You can read more about the format of the program and its goals [here](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/).

# Additional Information

## Who can propose a project and who can be a mentor?

Keploy members and members from the wider community can both propose projects, however, only Keploy members can be mentors.

## What is expected of a mentor?
Please read [The Mentor Guide](MENTOR-GUIDE.md).

## Information for applying contributors

Contributors should have knowledge of git, Go, and markdown for most projects since the project work heavily depends on them.

We invite contributors to look into [our open proposals for 2026](https://github.com/keploy/gsoc/tree/main/2026), ask mentors questions to understand the projects better and if interested apply for the project when the application period opens.

Mentors would like to know why the project interests the contributor, whether they have the pre-requisite skills, and most importantly, how they plan to implement it.

We encourage contributors to set up Keploy for local development and play around with the code and tests to get more comfortable with the project. See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started.
